# ts2019 challenges

This is a set of scripts to host operations related challenges. This repo can be used to install dependencies,
start challenges, and tear down/clean up after execution.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

We assume you are running an Ubuntu 18.04 VM image that can be destroyed and redeployed easily. The challenges make a best effort to clean up, but we will be installing global dependencies and may leave behind files/applications.


### Installing

### TODO

- [  ] add `tools/dependencies.sh` to provision
- [  ] add gitbook of challenges to docs
- [  ] add `start.sh` for challenge
- [  ] add `stop.sh` for challenge
- [  ] add `clean.sh` for challenge
